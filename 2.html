	<p id="s2">he is the original piece I wrote for CNN last year enterpreneurs,also known as "digital nomads".Since the whole "Wrok Online,Travel the World and Live the Dream" angel had been done to death in a million places,I decided to go the other direction and show the dark side of being a digital nomad- the challenges one faces, the emotional pitfalls, the social sacrifices.</p>
	<p id="s3">Predictably, CNN hated it .The editors hacked it to the pieces and aske dme to rewrite sections to make it less gloomy.But I was always fond of the original,so I'm posting it here unabridged.</p>
